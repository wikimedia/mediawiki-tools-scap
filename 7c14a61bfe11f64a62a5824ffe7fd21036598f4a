      "message": "I think there is a potential for deadlock in this model if the command produces \"enough\" output to stdout. The use of subprocess.PIPE without a select() or poll() loop to drain the pipe could result in the child process blocking on stdout if the pipe is full. In python 2.7.3 the default for Popen\u0027s bufsize parameter is 0 (unbuffered) so a pipe could block after as little as 512 bytes of output.",

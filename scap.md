# Introduction

*Scap* is a tool for deploying MediaWiki, MediaWiki extensions, and
supporting software, to servers at the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF).
It's meant to be used by the WMF release engineering and SRE teams,
and trusted other parties. In other words, Scap updates the software
that runs Wikipedia.

This document describes some of the acceptance criteria for Scap, and
how they can be verified automatically. As the document is written
many years after the software, it doesn't capture all the acceptance
criteria. New criteria are mostly added as the software is changed, to
cover the changed part.

Note that this document describes version 2 of Scap, not version 3,
which is a whole different code base.


## Scap documentation

This document doesn't try to document Scap itself. Instead, see the
following sources.

* The docs directory in the source tree.
  - online: <https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/tools/scap/+/master/docs/>
  - formatted: <https://doc.wikimedia.org/mw-tools-scap/>
* Wikitech:
  - version 2: <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Scap>
  - version 3: <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Scap3>


# Acceptance criteria

## Expected subcommands exist

This scenario verifies that every Scap subcommand that should exist,
does exist, by running it with the `--help` option. This means that the
commands exist and follow the normal Scap user interface pattern, and if
they're provided by a plugin, that the plugin can be found.

~~~scenario
given a built scap
then I can run scap apply-patches --help
then I can run scap cdb-json-refresh --help
then I can run scap cdb-rebuild --help
then I can run scap clean --help

then I can run scap wmf-beta-autoupdate --help
~~~

## scap version

This is a smoke test: if `scap version` runs, outputs something that
looks like a version number, and exits with a zero code, we're
satisfied. If this doesn't work, something is really badly wrong with
Scap or the test setup.

~~~scenario
given a built scap
when I run scap version
then the exit code is 0
then the output matches pattern "^\d+(\.\d+)+(-\S+)?$"
~~~

## scap without arguments

This is a smoke test: if `scap` without any arguments runs, and exits
with an exit code of one, it's good. At times, the exit code is other,
and there's a stack trace.

~~~scenario
given a built scap
when I run scap
then the exit code is 1
~~~


## Applying security patches for train

[Train]: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_deployment/Train_deploys#Apply_security_patches

[Train][] is the weekly manual deployment process at the Wikimedia
Foundation. Scap has an `apply-patches` subcommand that applies
security patches as part of the train deployment process. This section
explains the process as done manually, and then how the plugin's
behaviour is verified.

### The old manual process

This all needs to be run on the deployment server, as that's where the
security patches live. Security patches are sensitive and embargoed,
and can't be made public.

Source code for MediaWiki and its extensions is checked out as part of
earlier "scap prep" part of the train process. The tree looks like:

```
/srv/mediawiki-staging/php-1.35.0-wmf.30
`-- extensions
    `-- Goat
```

Similarly, the patches live under the `/srv/patches` directory, and
are put there before the train starts. For example:

```
/srv/patches/1.35.0-wmf.30
+-- core
|   +-- 01-T123.patch
|   `-- 02-T456.patch
`-- extensions
    `-- Goat
        +-- 01-T222.patch
        `-- 02-T333.patch
```

Patch files are named using an ordering prefix and a Phabricator task
identifier. The filename ends in `.patch`. Any other files can be
ignored.

The patches under `core` are applied to MediaWiki core, and those
under `extensions` are applied to the relevant extension. Thus:

* `/srv/patches/1.35.0-wmf.30/core/01-T123.patch` is applied in
  `/srv/mediawiki-staging/php-1.35.0-wmf.30`
* `/srv/patches/1.35.0-wmf.30/extensions/Goat/01-T222.patch` is applied in
  `/srv/mediawiki-staging/php-1.35.0-wmf.30/extensions/Goat`

Patches are applied, in the order of the filename ordering prefixes.
For example:

```{.sh .numberLines}
$ cd /srv/mediawiki-staging/php-1.35.0-wmf.30
$ git apply --check --3way /srv/patches/1.35.0-wmf.30/core/01-T123.patch
$ git am --3way /srv/patches/1.35.0-wmf.30/core/01-T123.patch
```

The `git apply --check` command verifies that the patch can be
applied. The `git am` command actually applies the patch. If either
command fails, the train should stop until the problem can be fixed.

### Applying security patches automatically

Scap has a subcommand, `scap apply-patches`, which attempts to apply
the patches. The command can be run many times, and it reports what
the outcome of applying each patch is. Any problems need to be fixed
by the person using Scap, as the software does not try to fix any
problems automatically.

This scenario constructs several git repositories, for MediaWiki core,
an extension, and a skin, all of which consist of
a file `file.php`, which contains several lines of text. There are
also patches for each repository: two good ones that change different
parts of the file, and one that expects a different content in the
file. See below for actual file contents.

First we set up the repository that pretends to be MediaWiki core,
and the patches for it.

~~~scenario
given an empty git repository at php-wmf.30
given file file.patch from file.patch
when I invoke, in php-wmf.30, git am ../file.patch
then the exit code is 0
then git repository php-wmf.30 is clean

given file patches/wmf.30/core/01-first.patch from good-patch-1
given file patches/wmf.30/core/02-second.patch from bad-patch
given file patches/wmf.30/core/03-third.patch from good-patch-2
~~~

Note that we populate the repository by applying a patch. This is so
that the version history matches what the patches have.

We then do the same for a mock extension: repository for the extension
and patches for it.

~~~scenario
given an empty git repository at php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo
when I invoke, in php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo, git am ../../../file.patch
then the exit code is 0
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is clean

given file patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/01-first.patch from good-patch-1
given file patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/02-second.patch from bad-patch
given file patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/03-third.patch from good-patch-2
~~~

We do the same for a mock skin: repository for the extension and
patches for it.

~~~scenario
given an empty git repository at php-wmf.30/skins/Bar
when I invoke, in php-wmf.30/skins/Bar, git am ../../../file.patch
then the exit code is 0
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is clean

given file patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/01-first.patch from good-patch-1
given file patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/02-second.patch from bad-patch
given file patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/03-third.patch from good-patch-2
~~~

Then we run `scap apply-patches`. This fails, because one of the
patches is bad, but we verify that the output is as expected and that
the repositories are left in the expected state.

~~~scenario
given an installed scap
when I run scap apply-patches -Dstage_dir:. -Dpatch_path:patches --train wmf.30
then the exit code is 1
then the output matches pattern "^\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/03-third.patch"
then git repository php-wmf.30 is dirty
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is dirty
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is dirty
~~~


If we run `scap apply-patches` at this point, it won't do anything,
and will tell us there is a problem. Being able to re-run the command
is useful: it tells you what patches have problems.

~~~scenario
when I run scap apply-patches -Dstage_dir:. -Dpatch_path:patches --train wmf.30
then the exit code is 1
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[FAILED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/02-second.patch"
then the output matches pattern "^\[SKIPPED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/03-third.patch"
then git repository php-wmf.30 is dirty
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is dirty
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is dirty
~~~

If we fix the problem, by terminating the in-progress `git am` in each
troubled git repository, and removing the offending patch, things can
progress. Note that in real life, it would be better to modify the
offending patch to keep the security fix, and not just blindly drop
it. However, that is hard to do in automated tests, so we just remove
it.

~~~scenario
when I run, in php-wmf.30, git am --abort
when I run, in php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo, git am --abort
when I run, in php-wmf.30/skins/Bar, git am --abort
when I remove patches/wmf.30/core/02-second.patch
when I remove patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/02-second.patch
when I remove patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/02-second.patch
then git repository php-wmf.30 is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is clean
~~~

We can now run `scap apply-patches` again and it succeeds.

~~~scenario
when I run scap apply-patches -Dstage_dir:. -Dpatch_path:patches --train wmf.30
then the exit code is 0
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[APPLIED\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/03-third.patch"
then git repository php-wmf.30 is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is clean
~~~

If we run `scap apply-patches` yet again, after all patches are
already applied, it's a benign operation.

~~~scenario
when I run scap apply-patches -Dstage_dir:. -Dpatch_path:patches --train wmf.30
then the exit code is 0
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/core/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/extensions/Foo/03-third.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/01-first.patch"
then the output matches pattern "\[OK\] /.*/patches/wmf.30/skins/Bar/03-third.patch"
then git repository php-wmf.30 is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/extensions/Foo is clean
then git repository php-wmf.30/skins/Bar is clean
~~~

All is well. The train can continue securely.

## scap sync fails

The `scap sync` command is being renamed to `scap sync-world`. The old
command now gives an error.

~~~scenario
given a built scap
when I run scap sync
then the exit code is 1
then stderr contains "scap sync-world"
~~~



## scap sync-world without --canary-wait-time works

The `scap sync-world` command takes an optional `--canary-wait-time` option.
Make sure it works without the option or rather fails in the right way.

~~~scenario
given a built scap
when I run scap sync-world
then the exit code is 1
then stderr contains "scap failed: RuntimeError sync-world requires SSH agent forwarding"
~~~

scap (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MediaWiki: Old stub entry points for scap (e.g., sync-file, sync-dir,
    mwversionsinuse, etc) are gone. Formerly old binstubs simply exited with a
    non-zero exit code. Subcommands are now the only way to scap.

  * MediaWiki: the canary logstash check for MediaWiki deploys now supports an
    explicit service name (via the `canary_service` configuration variable).
    This will allow us to monitor HHVM errors as well as MediaWiki errors on
    the canary hosts before a deployment. (Fixes T154646, T142784)

  * Scap3: Scap's rollback behavior has been greatly improved. Scap supports a
    global `failure_limit` and a per-group `failure_limit` -- if a deployment
    exceeds the number or percentage of failures specified by this limit a
    deploy will fail and you will be prompted to rollback. Also, if you opt to
    *not* continue a deployment on remaining deploy groups, you will receive
    the option to rollback. (Fixes T149008)

  * Scap3: This scap release has some rollback logic fixes. First, if there is
    initial ssh failure for a host, scap will no longer attempt a rollback on
    that host (since the same ssh failure will likely cause a rollback
    failure). Next, all previously deployed groups of servers will now be
    rolled-back -- not just the group of servers that had failures. (Fixes
    T150267 T145460)

  * MediaWiki: /srv/mediawiki is now a flattened git directory. This is the
    first step towards moving MediaWiki deployments to Scap3. This is not a
    change for deployers, but is a needed internal change.

  * MediaWiki: `scap sync-file` and `scap sync-dir` are the same command
    internally. `scap sync-dir` is deprecated.

  * MediaWiki: scap now checks if proxies and canaries are listed among the
    pooled servers (in mediawiki-installation) before attempting to deploy to
    those hosts.

  * MediaWiki/Scap3: A fancier progress bar is available. Simply set
    `fancy_progress: True` in your config file to use it.

  * MediaWiki: The `scap l10n-purge` subcommand is no more. Removed as it was
    largely unused and was broken without notice for quite some time.

  * Scap3: Old scap-created tags will now be removed from the deployment host
    as part of the deployment. The number of tags to keep is controlled by the
    `tags_to_keep` configuration variable. By default, scap keeps 20 tags.

  * Scap3: in a shameless attempt to promote the use of messages for the
    Server Admin Log for non-MediaWiki deployments the default Server Admin
    Log message has been changed from "(no message)" to "(no justification
    provided)"

  * Internally, scap now uses wildly experimental Docker tests for CI and
    local testing. All tests are now being run by CI (which was not true in
    the past).

  * Scap is moving closer to supporting python3, small changes in this release
    bigger changes are yet to come.

  * Scap's scap say command is now more compatible with cowsay(6). It now
    supports passing messages on stdin as well as the `--eyes` flag.

scap (3.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "scap sync-l10n" now has the message argument (fixes T152390)

scap (3.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * "scap deploy" no longer reports local commits when logging, now relies on
    last common ancestor with upstream. Prevents leaking security patches and
    instead reports public info.

 -- Chad Horohoe <chad@wikimedia.org>  Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:03:19 -0000

scap (3.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Old scap bin stubs (e.g., sync-file, sync-dir,
    mwversionsinuse, etc) will now exit 1, subcommands are now the only way to
    interact with scap, i.e., sync-file is now scap sync-file.

  * Scap linter now ignores auto autoload_static.php which was known to fail
    lint checks (Fixes T136009 - thank you Paladox)

  * Scap adds the sha1 of the commit being deployed to the announce log --
    this change affects scap3 repos.

  * This release fixes a bug where variables specified in vars.yaml were being
    overwritten in the opposite order (Fixes T150897)

  * Scap lockfiles now contain the message passed in the deployment, i.e. scap
    sync-dir wmf-config 'Update config' will create a lockfile with the
    message 'Update config'. If anyone else attempts to deploy while that
    lockfile is in place, they will be shown the lockfile message.

scap (3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scap learned how to lock all deployments at the server level. Previously
    it only knew how to lock deployments at the repo level.

  * Scap now tells users who holds the lock file (when deploys are locked).
    Permissions on the lockfile have changed to 600, making it harder to
    overwrite (Fixes T140914).

  * "scap sync-file" and "scap pull" got new flags, "--beta-only-change" and
    "--no-touch", respectively. When used, this prevents the normal action
    taken by "scap pull" to touch the wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php file
    which invalidate local caches.  This allows some syncs to avoid a
    potential problem with HHVM servers exhausting local cache when reading
    new files from disk. The option is now also always passed to `scap pull`
    by `scap sync-l10n` (fixes T149872 -- thank you Bryan Davis).

  * Scap learned to announce scap3 deployments in IRC. This should mean that
    deployers will no longer have to announce a deployment manually in
    *-operations -- scap will do it for them.

  * Scap3 updated the way it limits hosts and can now limit hosts from all
    groups, not just the default group (Fixes T149128).

  * HHVM restarts now happen via the /usr/local/bin/restart-hhvm script. This
    means that an individual server is now depooled via confctl before being
    restarted (thank you Giuseppe Lavagetto).

  * Scap3 learned about empty checks in the checks.yml file. This allows you
    to overwrite global checks in an environment specific checks.yml. These
    checks will be logged, but nothing will run (fixes T149668).

  * Scap3 added a "finalize" stage of deployment. This will allow for "promote"
    checks to execute before the final state is recorded and clean up of old
    rev directories is performed, and overall result in more consistent
    rollback behavior (Fixes T150267)

  * Scap learned how to use sub-sub commands, i.e., scap subcommand
    subsubcommand. None are yet implemented.

  * scap l10n-purge works once again, and restart_hhvm was restored (Fixes
    T146656).

  * Internally, scap simplified its usage of sudo calls. This means the
    internals are a bit more sane, unnecessary sudo calls, i.e., sudoing as
    yourself is less common throughout the code.

scap (3.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "scap deploy" can use an environment-specific config by adding an
    'environment' key under a domain in the scap.cfg ini file. Now
    environment-specific settings can apply to specific domains without the
    need to use the "--environment" flag (Closes: T134156).

  * "scap deploy-local" caches the last fetched .git/DEPLOY_HEAD locally at
    [repo]-cache/.config. As a result, deploy-local will no longer necessarily
    fetch .git/DEPLOY_HEAD at every stage of a deploy. This allows for the use
    of "scap deploy-local config_deploy" when a target is out-of-sync with the
    deployment server (Closes: T145373).

  * "scap deploy-local" got a new flag "--refresh-config" that will make
    deploy-local fetch .git/DEPLOY_HEAD from the deployment server. "scap
    deploy", internally, will use "scap deploy-local --refresh-config" at
    every stage of deployment to retain the old behavior of fetching a fresh
    copy of the config for each stage of deployment.

scap (3.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tyler Cipriani ]
  * Fix tab completion
    Tab completeion now works like git, i.e., it puts a space after the
    command but not after a completed directory name. Tab completion was
    slowing down deployers as it put an extra space after EVERYTHING.
    (Closes: T144244)
  * Make directories as euid
    Previously directories were being made as ruid. This was causing breakage
    as we move towards using config deployment (\o/) for Mathoid
    (Closes: T145194)

  [ Mukunda Modell ]
  * Add a better user prompting functionscap.utils.confirm
    needed as utils.ask proved to be a bit inflexible.
  * Look for plugins in user home directory.
    Find and load plugins from both ./scap/plugins and ~/.scap/plugins.

  [ Marko Obrovac ]
  * Docs: Introduce config_deploy and erb_syntax
    When doing config deploys, one needs to specify config_deploy in
    scap.cfg. Likewise, Scap3 has the neat feature where one can use the ERB
    syntax in templates, which eases the transition from Puppet.

  [ Chad Horohoe ]
  * Improve rsync behavior between masters/proxies/targets
    This should save like 8-9 useless rsync's during the sync-apaches stage
    and moves the co-master rsync (currently 1) to a more appropriate place

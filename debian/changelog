scap (3.15.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Feature: Rename "scap sync" to "scap sync-world". The old command
    now gives an error message and tells user to use the new command
    instead. See https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T250302 and give
    feedback if this bites you.
  * Feature: Add "scap list-patches", "scap test-patches", and
    "scap apply-patches" for train security patches.
  * Feature: Scap plugins from mediawiki-config have been added to the
    main Scap repository.
  * Bug: Regular expression for parsing exceptions in sh.py wasn't
    using raw strings.
  * Bug: Fixes to the subplot acceptance testing stuff to work with
    current Subplot tool.
  * Bug: Target host patterns with both ! and [] didn't used to work.
  * Refactor: avoid using a confusing variable name (lower case ell).
  * Packaging: drop run-time dependency on bash-completion. It's not
    necessary. If bash-completion is installed, completion works.
    Build-dependency is necessary, though.
  * Packaging: Add myself to the debian/control Uploaders field, and
    drop Chad. This should reflect current reality.
  * Python 3: Various changes for Python 3 compatibility, while
    keeping Python 2 compatibility.

  [Ahmon Dancy]
  * Feature: drop unused "scap swat" command.
  * Bug: Fix version parsing so it actually notices problems.
  * Bug: Fix unclear error message if mwscript is not found.

  [Antoine Musso]
  * Bug: Fix references to obsolete name tin.eqiad.wmnet.
  * Test: Pin flake8 version so we are not surprised by a newer
    version.
  * Performance: Use rsync's newer compression algorithm to use less
    CPU.

  [Tyler Cipriani]
  * Feature: Make user confirm they intend it, before running "scap
    sync". Can be bypassed with the --force option.

  * MediaWiki: Scap will run scap pull on all co-masters after syncing the
    staging directory to ensure that even out-of-sync targets get the correct
    code.

  * MediaWiki: Remove unused tasks.purge_l10n_cache()

  * MediaWiki and Scap3: Unify lock file handling between `deploy` and `sync`

  * Scap global lock file fix

  * MediaWiki: scap no longer looks for php5 or phtml files to lint

  * Scap3: scap deploy now has a new --dry-run option. This option causes the
    config_diff stage to run on the target. This option renders the
    configuration files being deployed by a repo in a temprorary file and
    diffs them against the live version of the files. The diff is sent to scap
    deploy-log for review by the deployer. Nothing is deployed as part of a
    deploy --dry-run.

  * Scap3: scap deploy will now announce the environment along with commit if
    the environment to which a repo is being deployed is not the default.

scap (3.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scap is now licensed under GPLv3 thanks to mmodell for spearheading this

  * Scap's logger learned to tolerate remote messages that contain a percent
    sign that isn't being used as part of a format string.

  * Scap lock code has been moved to its own module.

  * MediaWiki: all syncs will now update git info for MediaWiki and
    extensions.

  * MediaWiki: scap learned to use the absolute path when running sync
    commands. This means you can now run sync commands outside
    /srv/mediawiki-staging and they should still work (Fixes: T162220 --
    thanks TimStarling for your help tracking this down!).

  * Scap3: scap learned to reloading services in addition to being able to
    restart them (Fixes: T134001).

  * Scap3: scap say learned some new things to say...

  * Scap3: some FancyProgressReporter updates and improvements have been made.

  * MediaWiki on Scap3: Scap now ensures that the git directory created in
    /srv/mediawiki has all files including those that may be .gitignored in
    /srv/mediawiki-staging. This is needed to move to git-based syncs of
    MediaWiki.

 -- Tyler Cipriani <tcipriani@wikimedia.org>  Mon, 27 Feb 2017 11:53:24 -0700

scap (3.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add simple subcommand for logging to server admin log
    Sometimes it's annoying to context switch back to IRC. Also, there's been
    some talk about removing the IRC dependency for logging, so this would
    provide a useful fallback

  * Fix `failure_rate` percentages
    Configuring a `failure_rate` as a string percentage (e.g. '10%') now
    correctly calculates an integer (number of targets) based on the
    original size of the deploy group, not the `group_size` which splits
    groups into smaller subgroups.

  * Exclude empty deploy groups
    Avoid zero-size related bugs by validating `targets.DeployGroup` input,
    disallowing an empty targets list and/or a size of less than 1, and by
    refactoring `TargetList.get_deploy_groups` to skip inclusion of empty
    groups.

  * Make checks serial by default
    This is an update so that checks better fit deployer's (and my) mental
    model of checks. This also enables the workaround of having a check
    using the command `sleep 30` delay the execution of a subsequent check
    proposed in T156687.

  * Add sync_submodule() and use it in deploy().

  * Fix regression of deploy group continue prompt
    With D490 came a regression in the behavior of the continue prompt
    whereby the prompt was only given after each originally configured
    deploy group and not the smaller subgroups resulting from the configured
    `group_size`. The original behavior has been restored.

  * Fix MediaWiki git ident errors
    Because we use GIT_* environmental variables to indicate the deployer as
    the git commit author and the ssh_user as the git commiter those values
    will override anything in any git configuration files. As a result, an
    empty string for any one of those values will result in an ident (or
    similar) error in git.

scap (3.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MediaWiki scap3 feature flag

  [ Tyler Cipriani ]

 -- Tyler Cipriani <tcipriani@wikimedia.org>  Mon, 30 Jan 2017 13:36:15 -0700

scap (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * MediaWiki: Old stub entry points for scap (e.g., sync-file, sync-dir,
    mwversionsinuse, etc) are gone. Formerly old binstubs simply exited with a
    non-zero exit code. Subcommands are now the only way to scap.

  * MediaWiki: the canary logstash check for MediaWiki deploys now supports an
    explicit service name (via the `canary_service` configuration variable).
    This will allow us to monitor HHVM errors as well as MediaWiki errors on
    the canary hosts before a deployment. (Fixes T154646, T142784)

  * Scap3: Scap's rollback behavior has been greatly improved. Scap supports a
    global `failure_limit` and a per-group `failure_limit` -- if a deployment
    exceeds the number or percentage of failures specified by this limit a
    deploy will fail and you will be prompted to rollback. Also, if you opt to
    *not* continue a deployment on remaining deploy groups, you will receive
    the option to rollback. (Fixes T149008)

  * Scap3: This scap release has some rollback logic fixes. First, if there is
    initial ssh failure for a host, scap will no longer attempt a rollback on
    that host (since the same ssh failure will likely cause a rollback
    failure). Next, all previously deployed groups of servers will now be
    rolled-back -- not just the group of servers that had failures. (Fixes
    T150267 T145460)

  * MediaWiki: /srv/mediawiki is now a flattened git directory. This is the
    first step towards moving MediaWiki deployments to Scap3. This is not a
    change for deployers, but is a needed internal change.

  * MediaWiki: `scap sync-file` and `scap sync-dir` are the same command
    internally. `scap sync-dir` is deprecated.

  * MediaWiki: scap now checks if proxies and canaries are listed among the
    pooled servers (in mediawiki-installation) before attempting to deploy to
    those hosts.

  * MediaWiki/Scap3: A fancier progress bar is available. Simply set
    `fancy_progress: True` in your config file to use it.

  * MediaWiki: The `scap l10n-purge` subcommand is no more. Removed as it was
    largely unused and was broken without notice for quite some time.

  * Scap3: Old scap-created tags will now be removed from the deployment host
    as part of the deployment. The number of tags to keep is controlled by the
    `tags_to_keep` configuration variable. By default, scap keeps 20 tags.

  * Scap3: in a shameless attempt to promote the use of messages for the
    Server Admin Log for non-MediaWiki deployments the default Server Admin
    Log message has been changed from "(no message)" to "(no justification
    provided)"

  * Internally, scap now uses wildly experimental Docker tests for CI and
    local testing. All tests are now being run by CI (which was not true in
    the past).

  * Scap is moving closer to supporting python3, small changes in this release
    bigger changes are yet to come.

  * Scap's scap say command is now more compatible with cowsay(6). It now
    supports passing messages on stdin as well as the `--eyes` flag.

    last common ancestor with upstream. Prevents leaking security patches and

 -- Chad Horohoe <chad@wikimedia.org>  Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:03:19 -0000

scap (3.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Old scap bin stubs (e.g., sync-file, sync-dir,
    mwversionsinuse, etc) will now exit 1, subcommands are now the only way to
    interact with scap, i.e., sync-file is now scap sync-file.

  * Scap linter now ignores auto autoload_static.php which was known to fail
    lint checks (Fixes T136009 - thank you Paladox)

  * Scap adds the sha1 of the commit being deployed to the announce log --
    this change affects scap3 repos.

  * This release fixes a bug where variables specified in vars.yaml were being
    overwritten in the opposite order (Fixes T150897)

  * Scap lockfiles now contain the message passed in the deployment, i.e. scap
    sync-dir wmf-config 'Update config' will create a lockfile with the
    message 'Update config'. If anyone else attempts to deploy while that
    lockfile is in place, they will be shown the lockfile message.

 -- Tyler Cipriani <tcipriani@wikimedia.org>  Mon, 28 Nov 2016 09:03:50 -0700

scap (3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scap learned how to lock all deployments at the server level. Previously
    it only knew how to lock deployments at the repo level.

  * Scap now tells users who holds the lock file (when deploys are locked).
    Permissions on the lockfile have changed to 600, making it harder to
    overwrite (Fixes T140914).

  * "scap sync-file" and "scap pull" got new flags, "--beta-only-change" and
    "--no-touch", respectively. When used, this prevents the normal action
    taken by "scap pull" to touch the wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php file
    which invalidate local caches.  This allows some syncs to avoid a
    potential problem with HHVM servers exhausting local cache when reading
    new files from disk. The option is now also always passed to `scap pull`
    by `scap sync-l10n` (fixes T149872 -- thank you Bryan Davis).

  * Scap learned to announce scap3 deployments in IRC. This should mean that
    deployers will no longer have to announce a deployment manually in
    *-operations -- scap will do it for them.

  * Scap3 updated the way it limits hosts and can now limit hosts from all
    groups, not just the default group (Fixes T149128).

  * HHVM restarts now happen via the /usr/local/bin/restart-hhvm script. This
    means that an individual server is now depooled via confctl before being
    restarted (thank you Giuseppe Lavagetto).

  * Scap3 learned about empty checks in the checks.yml file. This allows you
    to overwrite global checks in an environment specific checks.yml. These
    checks will be logged, but nothing will run (fixes T149668).

  * Scap3 added a "finalize" stage of deployment. This will allow for "promote"
    checks to execute before the final state is recorded and clean up of old
    rev directories is performed, and overall result in more consistent
    rollback behavior (Fixes T150267)

  * Scap learned how to use sub-sub commands, i.e., scap subcommand
    subsubcommand. None are yet implemented.

  * scap l10n-purge works once again, and restart_hhvm was restored (Fixes
    T146656).

  * Internally, scap simplified its usage of sudo calls. This means the
    internals are a bit more sane, unnecessary sudo calls, i.e., sudoing as
    yourself is less common throughout the code.

scap (3.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "scap deploy" can use an environment-specific config by adding an
    'environment' key under a domain in the scap.cfg ini file. Now
    environment-specific settings can apply to specific domains without the
    need to use the "--environment" flag (Closes: T134156).

  * "scap deploy-local" caches the last fetched .git/DEPLOY_HEAD locally at
    [repo]-cache/.config. As a result, deploy-local will no longer necessarily
    fetch .git/DEPLOY_HEAD at every stage of a deploy. This allows for the use
    of "scap deploy-local config_deploy" when a target is out-of-sync with the
    deployment server (Closes: T145373).

  * "scap deploy-local" got a new flag "--refresh-config" that will make
    deploy-local fetch .git/DEPLOY_HEAD from the deployment server. "scap
    deploy", internally, will use "scap deploy-local --refresh-config" at
    every stage of deployment to retain the old behavior of fetching a fresh
    copy of the config for each stage of deployment.

  * Fix tab completion
    Tab completeion now works like git, i.e., it puts a space after the

  * Add a better user prompting functionscap.utils.confirm
    needed as utils.ask proved to be a bit inflexible.

  * Docs: Introduce config_deploy and erb_syntax

  * Improve rsync behavior between masters/proxies/targets

    and moves the co-master rsync (currently 1) to a more appropriate place

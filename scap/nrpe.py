    ~~~~~~~~~
    NRPE based deployment checks.

    Available Icinga/NRPE command definitions must be loaded and registered
    for use using `load` or `load_directory`, and `register`, before they can
    be used in `checks.yaml` configuration.

    Example `checks.yaml`:
        checks:
          service_endpoints:
            type: nrpe
            command: check_service_endpoints
            stage: promote

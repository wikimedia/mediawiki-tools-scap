class Command(object):
    """
    Command is used to store a parameterized shell command for reuse
    by cluster_ssh and other utilities. The idea is that we store the command,
    along with any arguments that need to be filled in, then we can call the
    command later just like a normal python function, which returns the shell
    command to be ran.

    Usage Example::

        import scap.cmd as cmd

        ssh = cmd.Command('/usr/bin/ssh', cmd.arg('user', '-oUser={}'))
        sudo = cmd.Command('sudo', cmd.arg('user', '-u {}'), '-n', '--')
        ssh('some.host', sudo('remote_cmd', 'some', 'args', user='sudo_user'),
            user='ssh_user')

        # result:

        ['/usr/bin/ssh',
         '-oUser=ssh_user',
         'some.host',
         'sudo',
         '-u sudo_user',
         '-n',
         '--',
         'remote_cmd',
         'some',
         'args']

    Represent a named parameter that will be passed to an instance of Command.

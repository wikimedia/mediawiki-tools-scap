On tin there are currently 12 /a/common/php-* directories and the chance that a deployer wants to send more than 3 of them to the apaches is pretty low. \n\nLimiting to php-* versions listed in wikiversions.json by default would save a whole lot of stat calls on both the rsync clients and servers when you look at it as 9 wm-core checkouts with extensions times ~400 mediawiki-installation hosts that are updated unnecessarily via rsync.",

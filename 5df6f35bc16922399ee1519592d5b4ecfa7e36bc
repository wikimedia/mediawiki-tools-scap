On tin there are currently 12 /a/common/php-* directories and the chance that a deployer wants to send more than 3 of them to the apaches is pretty low. \n\nLimiting to php-* versions listed in wikiversions.json by default would save a whole lot of stat calls on both the rsync clients and servers when you look at it as 9 wm-core checkouts with extensions times ~400 mediawiki-installation hosts that are updated unnecessarily via rsync.",

      "message": "My understanding is that bits needs at least 30 days of prior versions due to caching. We could be better about cleaning up which would get us down to 7 versions on any given Thursday if my math is right.\n\nThat\u0027s much better than 12 (11 really and one experiment that may be in the wrong place), but still more than 2 or 3. Moving away from rsync to git could make this a moot point, but that\u0027s a leap that I don\u0027t think we\u0027re quite ready to take yet.",

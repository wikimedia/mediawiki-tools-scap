      "message": "I\u0027m not sure yet if this can be made to work or not. The intent is that the process changing files in /srv/mediawiki-staging will will have GID\u003dwikidev so that the files remain modifiable by deployers. This is tricky because we don\u0027t want mwdeploy to generally be able to own wikidev (\u003chttps://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/UID\u003e). Not tested to see if sudo rules can grant effective GID for a group that the target user is not a member of. This may actually require a new local user instead.\n\nThis will certainly require new sudoers rules to be added to ops/puppet.",

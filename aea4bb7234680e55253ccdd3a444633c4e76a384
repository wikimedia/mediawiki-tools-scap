      "message": "I see the information hiding going the right direction here. Why should a logging component know anything about the embedding application\u0027s configuration management system? The handlers define a reasonable interface (I need a host and port to know who to send data to) and this method bridges that to the local usage.\n\nNow that I\u0027ve hoisted the use of this into cli.Application I could just as easily move the implementation there rather than delegating to this helper method if that makes anyone feel better.",

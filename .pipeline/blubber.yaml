# A Blubber spec file for a Docker container, based on Debian 9
# (stretch), where the Scap automated test suite can be run. This uses
# Debian packages to provide Scap dependencies, as those are what are
# used in production as well.
#
# Note that the package lists should match those in debian/control in
# the Scap source tree.

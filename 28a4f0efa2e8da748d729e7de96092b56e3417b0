      "message": "Contrary to how this interface is exposed, if I understand correctly, in rsync --include is not a whitelist, but an override for --exclude. \n\nWe expose it here as a whitelist by excluding everything by default.\n\nThis feels wrong, but I guess it\u0027s fine if it works. I suspect there is at least one edge case though: dot files (and anything else not matched by \u0027*\u0027).\n\nThose would be unexpectedly synced by sync-file and sync-dir.\n\nWhen only one file or directory is at play, would it make sense to change the source/target directory to that directory instead (like sync-common-file did) so that this is not needed? I wonder why that is no longer the case (is there some issue with other options or scripts involved when rsync is not acting from the perspective of \"common/\"?).",

      "message": "My primary reason for going in the whitelisted paths direction for sync-common is to enable future changes to include additional files with a sync. These files may be git version information or other files that should be updated along with a single file or directory sync.\n\nI will run some tests to see if your concern about `--exclude\u003d*` being insufficient to protect against unexpected dot file changes is warranted.",

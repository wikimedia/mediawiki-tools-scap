**Scap** is the deployment script used by Wikimedia Foundation to publish
code and configuration on production web servers.


Running tests
=============

Scap comes with a unit test suite implemented using pytest and invoked
using tox.

On Debian 10 (buster) you need the following packages installed to run
the test suite:

   build-essential locales-all git python2 python3 python-all-dev
   python3-all-dev tox php

After this, run the ``tox`` command on the command line to run the
tests. It uses the tox.ini file to know what to do. Edit that file to
drop any Python3 versions you don't have installed from the
``envlist`` line.

Alternatively, you can specify python environments against which to run the
test suite by selecting a custom envlist in ``tox`` via the ``-e`` option,
i.e., ``tox -e py27``.

Building a .deb
===============

Run this command to build a scap.deb package under Docker, for your
own use (not for SRE to install on production hosts):

  ./build-deb-in-docker ~/tmp/scap-deb

The directory given as an argument must exist. The resulting package
files will be put into that directory.

Reporting Issues
================

You can report issues to the `#scap
